PacMen Description:
This is a fun computer game that you can load into google chrome. Press the 'Add PacMan' button to pull up the first Pacman. Press the 'Start Game' button and the Pacman will move across the screen.  You can continue to add more Pacmen as you press the 'Add PacMan' button as you continue to press the 'Start Game' button the Pacmen's velocity will increase and move faster across the screen. 

How To Run:
You will need to download the 4 Pacman pictures in my images file.  Make sure you link the JavaScript logic file in your index.html file if you want to create your own version of the game. Also in your index.html file include button tags to employ the 'Start Game' button and the 'Add PacMan' button. Also, in the index.html file, you must include the onclick command equaling to your functions to make the buttons clickable and functional. 

Improvements:
To improve this exercise I would like the Pacman to be able to open and close their mouths to resemble the original game/character. I believe this would be done by adding more logic to the js file and making the newimg src equal to all the images needed for the pacman to open and close their mouths. I am not sure how to make the opening and closing of the mouth smooth with each Pacman but that is something I would like to dig more into.
